## List of differences

- All fx are from other open source websites but we have tried to be as same as possible to the original game
- Little particles on bottom bouncers that push up the ball to save it dont appear
- The highscore points summation is a little bit different from the original game, it doesnt add highscore points in each frame but once    the character finishes the game

## Description of the combo implemented

When ball enters in one of the mid holes, the ball is teleported in his neighbour hole and bonus X2 is activated to get the double of points until the ball die. This is the maximum approximation that exists in the original game about combo and we have implemented
